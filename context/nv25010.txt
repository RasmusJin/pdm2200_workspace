PIN CONFIGURATION

Description

NV25010, NV25020 and NV25040 are EEPROM Serial 1/2/4−Kb
SPI Automotive Grade 0 devices internally organized as 128x8, 256x8
and 512x8 bits. They feature a 16−byte page write buffer and support
the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. The devices are enabled
through a Chip Select (CS) input. In addition, the required bus signals
are clock input (SCK), data input (SI) and data output (SO) lines. The
HOLD input may be used to pause any serial communication with the
NV250x0 device. The device features software and hardware write
protection, including partial as well as full array protection. Byte
Level On−Chip ECC (Error Correction Code) makes the device
suitable for high reliability applications. The device offers an
additional Identification Page which can be permanently write
protected.

Pin Description

Functional Description

SI: The serial data input pin accepts op−codes, addresses
and data. In SPI modes (0,0) and (1,1) input data is latched
on the rising edge of the SCK clock input.
SO: The serial data output pin is used to transfer data out of
the device. In SPI modes (0,0) and (1,1) data is shifted out
on the falling edge of the SCK clock.
SCK: The serial clock input pin accepts the clock provided
by the host and used for synchronizing communication
between host and NV250x0.
CS: The chip select input pin is used to enable/disable the
NV250x0. When CS is high, the SO output is tri−stated (high
impedance) and the device is in Standby Mode (unless an
internal write operation is in progress). Every communication
session between host and NV250x0 must be preceded by a
high to low transition and concluded with a low to high
transition of the CS input.
WP: The write protect input pin will allow all write
operations to the device when held high. When WP pin is
tied low all write operations are inhibited.
HOLD: The HOLD input pin is used to pause transmission
between host and NV250x0, without having to retransmit
the entire sequence at a later time. To pause, HOLD must be
taken low and to resume it must be taken back high, with the
SCK input low during both transitions. When not used for
pausing, the HOLD input should be tied to VCC, either
directly or through a resistor.

The NV250x0 device supports the Serial Peripheral
Interface (SPI) bus protocol, modes (0,0) and (1,1). The
device contains an 8−bit instruction register. The instruction
set and associated op−codes are listed in Table 7.
Reading data stored in the NV250x0 is accomplished by
simply providing the READ command and an address.
Writing to the NV250x0, in addition to a WRITE command,
address and data, also requires enabling the device for
writing by first setting certain bits in a Status Register, as will
be explained later.
After a high to low transition on the CS input pin, the
NV250x0 will accept any one of the six instruction op−codes
listed in Table 7 and will ignore all other possible 8−bit
combinations. The communication protocol follows the
timing from Figure 2.
The NV250x0 features an additional Identification Page
(16 bytes) which can be accessed for Read and Write
operations when the IPL bit from the Status Register is set
to “0”. The user can also choose to make the Identification
Page permanent write protected.

Status Register

The IPL (Identification Page Latch) bit determines
whether the additional Identification Page (IPL = 0) or main
memory array (IPL = 1) can be accessed both for Read and
Write operations. The IPL bit is set by the user with the
WRSR command and is volatile. The IPL bit is
automatically set to 1 after read/write operations. The LIP
(Lock Identification Page) bit is set by the user with the
WRSR command and is non−volatile. When set to 0, the
Identification Page is permanently write protected (locked
in Read−only mode).
Note: The IPL and LIP bits cannot be set to 0 using the same
WRSR instruction. If the user attempts to set (“0”) both the
IPL and LIP bit in the same time, these bits cannot be written
and therefore they will remain unchanged.

The Status Register, as shown in Table 8, contains a
number of status and control bits.
The RDY (Ready) bit indicates whether the device is busy
with a write operation. This bit is automatically set to 1 during
an internal write cycle, and reset to 0 when the device is ready
to accept commands. For the host, this bit is read only.
The WEL (Write Enable Latch) bit is set/reset by the
WREN/WRDI commands. When set to 1, the device is in a
Write Enable state and when set to 0, the device is in a Write
Disable state.
The BP0 and BP1 (Block Protect) bits determine which
blocks are currently write protected. They are set by the user
with the WRSR command and are non−volatile. The user is
allowed to protect a quarter, one half or the entire memory,
by setting these bits according to Table 9. The protected
blocks then become read−only.

WRITE OPERATIONS
Write Enable and Write Disable

The NV250x0 device powers up into a write disable state.
The device contains a Write Enable Latch (WEL) which
must be set before attempting to write to the memory array
or to the status register. In addition, the address of the
memory location(s) to be written must be outside the
protected area, as defined by BP0 and BP1 bits from the
status register.

The internal Write Enable Latch and the corresponding
Status Register WEL bit are set by sending the WREN
instruction to the NV250x0. Care must be taken to take the
CS input high after the WREN instruction, as otherwise the
Write Enable Latch will not be properly set. WREN timing
is illustrated in Figure 3. The WREN instruction must be
sent prior to any WRITE or WRSR instruction.
The internal write enable latch is reset by sending the
WRDI instruction as shown in Figure 4. Disabling write
operations by resetting the WEL bit, will protect the device
against inadvertent writes.

page, thus possibly overwriting previously loaded data.
Following completion of the write cycle, the NV250x0 is
automatically returned to the write disable state.

Once the WEL bit is set, the user may execute a write
sequence, by sending a WRITE instruction, an 8−bit address
and data as shown in Figure 5. For the NV25040, bit 3 of the
write instruction opcode contains A8 address bit. Internal
programming will start after the low to high CS transition.
During an internal write cycle, all commands, except for
RDSR (Read Status Register) will be ignored. The RDY bit
will indicate if the internal write cycle is in progress (RDY
high), or the device is ready to accept commands (RDY
low).

Write Identification Page

The additional 16−byte Identification Page (IP) can be
written with user data using the same Write commands
sequence as used for Page Write to the main memory array
(Figure 6). The IPL bit from the Status Register must be
set to 0 using the WRSR instruction, before attempting
to write to the IP. The address bits [A8:A4] are Don’t Care
and the [A3:A0] bits define the byte address within the
Identification Page. In addition, the Byte Address must point
to a location outside the protected area defined by the BP1,
BP0 bits from the Status Register. When the full memory
array is write protected (BP1, BP0 = 1,1), the write
instruction to the IP is not accepted and not executed. Also,
the write to the IP is not accepted if the LIP bit from the
Status Register is set to 0 (the page is locked in Read−only
mode).

Page Write

After sending the first data byte to the NV250x0, the host
may continue sending data, up to a total of 16 bytes,
according to timing shown in Figure 6. After each data byte,
the lower order address bits are automatically incremented,
while the higher order address bits (page address) remain
unchanged. If during this process the end of page is
exceeded, then loading will “roll over” to the first byte in the

Write Status Register

Write Protection

The Status Register is written by sending a WRSR
instruction according to timing shown in Figure 7. Only bits
2, 3, 4 and 6 can be written using the WRSR command.

When WP input is low all write operations to the memory
array and Status Register are inhibited. WP going low while
CS is still low will interrupt a write operation. If the internal
write cycle has already been initiated, WP going low will
have no effect on any write operation to the Status Register
or memory array.

READ OPERATIONS
Read from Memory Array

internal write cycle is in progress, the RDSR command will
output the full content of the status register. For easy
detection of the internal write cycle completion, we
recommend sampling the RDY bit only through the polling
routine. After detecting the RDY bit “0”, the next RDSR
instruction will always output the expected content of the
status register.

To read from memory, the host sends a READ instruction
followed by a 8−bit address (for the NV25040, bit 3 of the
read instruction opcode contains A8 address bit).
After receiving the last address bit, the NV250x0 will
respond by shifting out data on the SO pin (as shown in
Figure 8). Sequentially stored data can be read out by simply
continuing to run the clock. The internal address pointer is
automatically incremented to the next higher address as data
is shifted out. After reaching the highest memory address,
the address counter “rolls over” to the lowest memory
address, and the read cycle can be continued indefinitely.
The read operation is terminated by taking CS high.

Read Identification Page

Reading the additional 16−byte Identification Page (IP) is
achieved using the same Read command sequence as used
for Read from main memory array (Figure 8). The IPL bit
from the Status Register must be set to 0 before
attempting to read from the IP. The [A3:A0] are the
address significant bits that point to the data byte shifted out
on the SO pin. If the CS continues to be held low, the internal
address register defined by [A3:A0] bits is automatically
incremented and the next data byte from the IP is shifted out.
The byte address must not exceed the 16−byte page
boundary.

Read Status Register

To read the status register, the host simply sends a RDSR
command. After receiving the last bit of the command, the
NV250x0 will shift out the contents of the status register on
the SO pin (Figure 9). The status register may be read at any
time, including during an internal write cycle. While the

Hold Operation

below the POR trigger level. This bi−directional POR
behavior protects the device against ‘brown−out’ failure
following a temporary loss of power.
The NV250x0 device powers up in a write disable state
and in a low power standby mode. A WREN instruction
must be issued prior to any writes to the device.
After power up, the CS pin must be brought low to enter
a ready state and receive an instruction. After a successful
byte/page write or status register write, the device goes into
a write disable mode. The CS input must be set high after the
proper number of clock cycles to start the internal write
cycle. Access to the memory array during an internal write
cycle is ignored and programming is continued. Any invalid
op−code will be ignored and the serial output pin (SO) will
remain in the high impedance state.

The HOLD input can be used to pause communication
between host and NV250x0. To pause, HOLD must be taken
low while SCK is low (Figure 10). During the hold condition
the device must remain selected (CS low). During the pause,
the data output pin (SO) is tri−stated (high impedance) and
SI transitions are ignored. To resume communication,
HOLD must be taken high while SCK is low.
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
The NV250x0 device incorporates Power−On Reset
(POR) circuitry which protects the internal logic against
powering up in the wrong state. The device will power up
into Standby mode after VCC exceeds the POR trigger level
and will power down into Reset mode when VCC drops
